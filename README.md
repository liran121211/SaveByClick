** All guidelines are according to the DJANGO project created in PYCHARM only! **


The project is developed and compatible with Django version 2.2.12 and above.
In order to start the project, a new DJANGO project must be opened and all the files transferred to the project's parent folder, for example if the new project folder is:
C: \ Users \ XXX \ PycharmProjects \ DJANGO-PROJECT
All archived files should be moved to the DJANGO-PROJECT folder

Constraints:
It is not possible to access a database directly without adding the IP address of the computer from which it is accessed because it is stored by DigitalOcean security protocols, so in order to access the database you must ask us to add your IP address

To activate the local system, the following plugins must be installed by entering the following commands in the terminal:
pip install django-ckeditor-5
pip install django-countries
pip install Faker
pip install django-ckeditor
pip install psycopg2
pip install django-twilio
pip install Pillow

In order to start the project, the following command must be written exactly without change in the terminal:
manage.py runserver --insecure

If the command does not run the local server it is because your IP address is not allowed to connect to a database
